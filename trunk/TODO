TODO:

Add proper ChangeLog after we get svn working.

Roadmap:

* Authorization system for gentoo developers.
* Subscription service to mail new pkg info by herd/maintainer.


RL:
- stu's blog functionality
- per-pkg regexps to compare versions
- check per-pkg URLs (homepages) for version numbers

---------------------------------------------------------------

me2dload.py
    Check filesize on fm's website and don't download
    if same as last download. We need to keep the filesize
    somewhere because the bz2 file is uncompressed.
    (Can read http header with urrlib)

    Add verbose option to help debugging.
    Theres a lot of commented code already in place.


me2sql.py
    Add a verbose option to help debugging.
