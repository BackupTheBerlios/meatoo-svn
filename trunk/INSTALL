1) Get the source:

Check out the latest svn sources:

svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/meatoo/trunk

Or if you have been added to the project:

svn checkout \
svn+ssh://developername@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/meatoo/trunk
cd trunk

2) Configure:

Copy and edit the example config files:
cp meatoo.conf.example meatoo.conf
cp cherrypy.conf.example cherrypy.conf

The cherrypy.conf should be fine as is.
Edit meatoo.conf and enter your mysql username/password.
Create a mysql database named "meatoo".
The tables will be created automatically.

Setup misc data directories:
mkdir /usr/share/meatoo
cp static/* /usr/share/meatoo/
mkdir /var/tmp/meatoo

3) Start server:

./cherry_meatoo.py

4) Populate database:

This is what is run every 12 hours via cron at approx 12 UTC:
me2dload -d -t
me2sql -u -r


To run behind Apache:

This will allow you to use a vhost and let Apache serve static content which is a bit more efficient than CherryPy.
You'll need mod_rewrite enabled in Apache.

Sample vhost config section with cherrypy server running on port 8099:

NameVirtualHost 192.168.1.111:80

<VirtualHost 192.168.1.111:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@meatoo.kicks-ass.net
    ServerName meatoo.kicks-ass.net
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule ^/static/(.*) /usr/share/meatoo/$1 [L]
    RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://127.0.0.1:8099/$1 [P]
    #RewriteLog logs/rewrite.meatoo.log
    #RewriteLogLevel 9
    ErrorLog @rel_logfiledir@/meatoo.kicks-ass.net-error_log
    CustomLog @rel_logfiledir@/meatoo.kicks-ass.net-access_log common
</VirtualHost>
